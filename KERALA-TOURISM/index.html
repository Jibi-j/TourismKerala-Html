                    <figcaption>Munnar-Hill Station</figcaption>
                    <p>Munnar, the famed hill station of south India, is a romantic locale where natural beauty is
                        everywhere to visit, explore and to enjoy. Munnar is situated at the confluence of three
                        mountain streams – Muthirapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundala – and the word ‘Munnar’ means three
                        rivers in Malayalam. Situated about 1600m above sea level, the hill station had been the summer
                        resort of the British Government during the colonial era. Imprints of the colonial past stand
                        tall in the Munnar town in the form of English country cottages. Virgin forests, savannah,
                        rolling hills, scenic valleys, numerous streams, huge splashy waterfalls, sprawling tea
                        plantations and winding walkways are all part of the great holiday experience on offer for a
                        traveler to Munnar.Munnar is also known for Neelakurinji, a rare plant which flowers only once
                        in twelve years. The
                        ‘kurinji season’ in Munnar is a magnificent sight when the hills and valleys get bathed in the
                        blue of the Neelakurinji blooms.</p>
